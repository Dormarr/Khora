<h1>Dormarr's Sandbox</h1>
Starting as a fun project to mess around with stuff in Unity, this developed into a lowkey obsession. The goal... to create a functioning digital ecosystem, mimicking nature to a degree of detail that borders on the senseless.

I haven't fully decided where this is going though, whether it will lean more into being a pixelated world sim, or a functioning survival sandbox game. The journey to working out where it will land is the fun part though I suppose! I am actively updating it, playing with new concepts and teaching myself programming through a project that I'll also be making the art for.

I'm just one man though, so progress is relatively slow. You can follow along with my devlog on itch.io at: https://dormarr.itch.io/dormarrs-sandbox
